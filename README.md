## 12-Employee-Tracker

```
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my organization
SO THAT I can organize and keep tabs on my business
```

The goal of this project was to develop a command line application in node, written in javascript using the help of a number of npm packages including mysql and inquirer. This employee tracker would relay data from a database and allow somone working with the CLI to add people to the database.
